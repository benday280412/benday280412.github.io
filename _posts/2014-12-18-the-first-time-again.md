So I've decided to start blogging again.  To be fair, I can't really claim to have actually started the first time, all I managed to write was a single post declaring that I was entering the blogosphere, swiftly followed by nothing.  Still, that was then and this is now and this time I'm tooled up.

The weapon of choice, [Jekyll][jekyll] hosted via [GitHub][github-pages] Pages, thanks to Gayan Virajith for his awesome theme [Harmony][harmony].  

Given that I've never used Jekyll before, is was a sinch to setup and get running.  The content creation cycle is super light weight and deployment is managed via Git.  There's tonnes of guides out there on how to set it all up, but in the interests of practice, I may well do one of my own.

In terms of content, the plan is for this blog to talk about the organisations, trends and technologies that I come across in my day to day life.  Whether that's through work or play.  Some of the articles may be pretty low level technology based, some more general discussion pieces, to be honest I'm just planning to see how it goes.

So, watch this space and feel free to get in touch or comment as posts start to emerge.
