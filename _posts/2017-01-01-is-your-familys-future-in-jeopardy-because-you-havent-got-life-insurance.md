## Do you think Life Insurance is too expensive? So Do 64% of fellow Americans, But They're Wrong!

In a recent survey of US households 59% of people without cover reported that they don't have life insurance due to other financial priorities.  In fact, it was ranked 7th most important financial concern in a recent poll.

The table below shows average annual policy costs which demonstrates that for the price of a weeks' worth of Starbucks, or a couple of months’ worth of Netflix, most people could get some form of coverage.

|   20   |      $13.92     |        $9.62       |      $18.27     |        $13.13      |

If it were my family without coverage, I think I'd priorities my family’s future financial security over a couple of hot cups of Joe. **Wouldn't you?**

## Do you know what would happen to your loved ones in the advent of your untimely death?

Over a 3rd of people admit to having no idea how they would cope if the family's main earner died unexpectedly. A mind blowing 70% of US households, with dependents under 18 years of age wouldn't be able to meet their existing financial commitments. In fact, 40% of families with at least one child report that they would have financial difficulties in the first month following the bereavement.

When you consider that the average cost of a funeral is around **$10,000** it's easy to understand why many families would immediately be unable to meet their existing financial commitments.

When you've just lost your spouse, at one of the hardest times in your life, do you really want to be worrying about paying the bills?

## I've got group cover, so I'm OK, right ?

It's not all doom and gloom. There are at least 60% of the population that are covered by some kind of life insurance policy, which is great news. Interestingly, this doesn't all come from private policies.

20% of males and 18% of females own group life insurance provided by their employer, whilst 26% of males and 27% of females own only private policies. The remainder receiving cover from both group and private policies.

This is good news that this population have current cover, however those benefiting from only group cover need to be aware that this cover will end upon termination of employment. There have been cases of individuals leaving paid employment, thus ending their policy cover only to die shortly afterward. Only later did their loved ones discover they had no coverage.

## So why are do so many people have no cover or inadequate cover?

Phycologists will tell you that we're not good at optimizing for the long term, nor do we like to talk and plan for death. Yet, unlike much else in life, death is one thing we can depend on.

Each year, some 2.6 million Americans die, for a range of reasons, across all age ranges. This equates to around **6,850 people a day**, with roughly 50% of that population not having any life insurance. Of those that do, it's estimated that over 20% do not have adequate cover. This is leaving grieving families not only struggling to get to grips with their loss, but also grappling with a bleak financial future.

Government statistics provide some more insight into the biggest killers amongst our fellow Americans.

We're already below OECD average life expectancy, with an average of 78 years, but around 8 in 1000 people will also die from unnatural causes.

| Cause                 | Death Count |
|:----------------------|:------------|
|  Heart Disease        |   633,842   |
|  Cancer               |   595,930   |
|  Respiratory Diseases |   155,041   |
|  Accidents            |   146,571   |
|  Stroke               |   140,323   |
|  Alzheimer’s          |   110,561   |
|  Diabetes             |   79,535    |
|  Influenza/Pneumonia  |   57,062    |
|  Nephritis            |   49,959    |
|  Suicide              |   44,193    |

Couple this with one of the highest rates of firearm-related injuries in the western world, taking 10 soles per 100,000, it becomes clear that death is not something to ignore and needs to be planned for.

> unlike much else in life, death is one thing we can depend on

The harsh reality is that **you** will die, unfortunately it comes to us all, the question is when. Don't leave it to chance and risk leaving your family worrying about keeping the house whilst trying to plan your funeral. **Get cover**, even if just for a 10-year term. For the sake of a few dollars you can buy protection from your family's future.
