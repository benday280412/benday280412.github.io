description: The start of my journey on how to leverage the internet to make a better life for me and my family.

It's been a few years since doing anything on this blog, but that's all set to change...again!

Originally I was going to focus on the technical topics that popped up during my day to day work which I thought were interesting and noteworthy, and there may still be some of that in here, but the main goal has changed. It's probably going to be all over the place to start with, but starting something and improving over time is a significant improvement over trying to get the perfect first post. As evidenced by the three year hiatus, it just doesn't happen.

> "Perfect is the enemy of good".

So what is am i going to talk about here? Well over the past few years I've become increasingly frustrated by the 9-to-5 grind that I seem to be locked into. Don't get me wrong, there's tonnes of good stuff going on in my life and for that I'm truly grateful, but I've had a growing sense that there is more to life than working for someone else for the next forty years, only to realise that at the end of it all you've spent most of your life doing what someone else told you to do, not what you were really passionate about.

So, in a bid to gain more freedom, to spend more time with the people I'm close to and to do more of the things that I love, I'm committing here, in black and white, to actively pursuing that goal. To pouring real focus and energy into leveraging the incredible power of the internet and the various platforms it offers up to see if it is possible to attain that freedom.

There's tonnes of people putting out great content on this topic and many of the loudest voices have been doing it for a few years and so have managed to build a successful platform for themselves, which is awesome. But when you look at where most of these successful internet entrepreneurs are at, it just seems so unobtainable, so far out of reach that it's easy to just click on the next video and do nothing to change your own life. Well not anymore!

This blog is going to chart my journey on trying to explore this crazy world of the modern internet, to see if I, an average guy, that doesn't blog, YouTube, affiliate market, sell online and knows pretty much nothing about how to start any of them can actually figure out how to become successful and as a result gain some of that freedom I'm looking for.

If you're looking for expert advice, maybe this is not the place to come...yet! But if you're like me and you've got that gnawing feeling in the bottom of your stomach that there's is another way and you want to see someone give it a go, get it wrong but dust themselves off and try again, then I'd be happy to share the ups and downs of this journey.

Just getting this post written felt pretty hard, but itâ€™s out there and getting that commitment down on paper feels awesome.  Step one, done! Exciting times ahead!
