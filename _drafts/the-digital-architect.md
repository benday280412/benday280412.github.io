The digital architect, the latest in an ever-increasing line of IT architect designations and one that whilst growing in popularity, is somewhat lacking in definition.  We’ve been bouncing this around in the office over the past few days trying to pin down what makes a digital architect and how, if at, this is different from the list of existing roles out there.

Without providing an exhaustive list of architect roles, it’s worth calling out some of the ones that would be central to driving new solutions for an organisation.

Enterprise Architect
Solution Architect
Technical Architect
 
It’s generally these three roles, working in concert, that shape and deliver the change agendas for organisations.  Of course there are many others from security and integration to infrastructure and data that play an important part, but creating new solutions and bringing them to market is primarily driven by these three.

The enterprise architect is thinking about the broad strategy, understating the business imperative and the existing change agenda.  These are the people helping to define the broad parameters within which the solutions must fit.  Flesh this out

The solution architects are the ones creating individual solutions, moving towards the overall goal laid down by the enterprise architects.  The high-level solution design, interfaces into existing systems, deployment and operations concerns are all dealt with by this role. Flesh this out

Finally, the technical architects are the individuals thinking about the low-level application architecture.  How the application breakdown into individual components, how those components interrelate and ultimately how they manifest themselves in the real world. Flesh this out

The problem with breaking these roles into three is that it creates room for people to become detached from the real task at hand.  It’s all too easy for the technical guys to get too focused on the latest shiny framework, whilst the enterprise team become detached from the reality of making shit happen on the ground and the solution guys are just trying to get a project delivered.  

I once had a conversation with an enterprise architect about a particular project that sat in their portfolio.  The project was suffering some challenges at the time and these were further exacerbated by a recent interjection by said architect.  When I floated the idea that perhaps his input had rendered that project even harder to deliver, he responded by saying that delivery wasn’t his responsibility.  I nearly fell off my chair, how can someone who’s sole focus should be delivering business value make such a statement.  We used to have a bit of a saying at a previous place of work.  If we ever found ourselves disappearing up our architectural ass, we’d remind ourselves that we’re there to sell more kettles!  It always helped me remember why we were doing what we were doing.

So if id doesn’t work having these roles spread across different people, then we should role them into one right!  Well, no, I don’t think so.  The reality is that the enterprise roles are far to big and wide ranging to allow people to operate at such a high level of detail and also be able to deliver individual projects.

So if there already challenges with just three roles.  And we know we have a bunch of other architects in the mix, where do digital architects fit and how on earth does this make the situation any better.

The conclusion I’ve come to is that they don’t!  I think the reason people are asking for digital architects on job boards or marketing themselves as digital is due to our need to label stuff.  When you look at the content of many of the role out there they span a wide range or experience and detail levels.  From key leadership roles within multimillion pound transformation programmes to ruby on rails developers with solution design experience.

Market is just asking for the same roles
The difference is the new skills, tech, method and patterns
The level of detail is very much aligned to the existing roles
This however suffers from the same issue of suffering from disconnection from the other architect roles
So maybe this is the difference, modern successful digital architects are a combination of all three.
In a few years time, when we’ve stopped calling it digital, well just be architects again
IDEO T shaped people was used to describe someone with deep specialise, but good breadth, and this applies to architecture
If we think about each disciple as a T, what we really want is a stacked T, breath and depth in the core disciplines of app, sol and ent.
We’re not expecting expertise across all, but effective architects, particularly in the digital age and beyond need to be aware of the how the systems they are designing are being built, what patterns and assemblies of patterns are available to them and why one is more appropriate for a given situation than another.  
They need to be aware of how to build, what to build and where it fits into the broader eco system.  This is a digital architect, or as I said in a few years, just a good old architect.
