- Intro to private label

Private labelling is getting a lot of attention at the moment, and for good reason. Ordinary folk like you and me can gain access to the huge number of suppliers across the globe and take existing products, stick a label on them, and sell them as our own. It's even possible to make minor modifications modify or create entirely new products, although this last option certainly a more costly and technically demanding option.

This is not new stuff, established organisations have been working with manufacturers in China, India and beyond for years to create products for them. What's changed more recently is that it's now much easier to get in touch with these factories through sites like [Global sources][1] or [Alibaba][2]. This coupled with the incredible power of Amazon's marketplace, it's possible to ship directly from the manufacture and into Amazon's warehouse using their [FBA][3] offering. Once it's there, you can start selling and hopefully making some nice profit.

This sounds dead easy right? Well as with all things, the devil is in the detail and there's certainly a lot of detail to get to grips with as a beginner. I'm hoping to cover off some of the key stages involved in going from nothing, to actually having something for sale in Amazon. This is not going to get into a lot of detail, we'll do that in a the upcoming posts.

# Step one: Find a product

It's seems kinda obvious that you need something to sell, but this is a really critical step to get right. There's a lot of systems, techniques and tools available that dig into this topic, and I'll happily share my approach in another post, but at a high level, you need to find something that's in demand, selling well but that isn't

 - Find products
 - Find supplier
 - Samples
 - Spec out final product
 - Ship it into Amazon
 - Sell, sell, Sell
