Hi, I'm Ben, I'm a mobile solution architect, based in the UK working out of London.

I currently work for [UST Global][ust] a global consultancy helping brands across the world create and run great IT solution.

My current focus is mobile solutions and their related technologies, but I'm interested in anything digital that's changing the way people live their lives.

I'm also working on a startup, [Huwun][], which is due to launch really soon.
