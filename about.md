Hey, my name is Ben.  This blog is a bit of a mix about tech topics, but also charts my attempts to make use of the amazing power of the internet to engage with new and interesting people and to create a better life for me and my family.

I'm currently working with a large consulting firm as a Digital Architect which means I get to work with some great companies and help them solve interesting technical challenges.

I'm also married to my beautiful wife Claire and have an awesome son William, or as we call him the Mini Beast.
